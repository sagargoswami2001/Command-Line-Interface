# Command Line Interface:-
The command line interface (also known as CLI) is a means to interact with a command line script. Python comes with several different libraries that allow you to write a command line interface for your scripts, but the standard way for creating a CLI in Python is currently the Python argparse library.

# Click Module in Python:-
Python click module is used to create command-line (CLI) applications. It is an easy-to-use alternative to the standard optparse and argparse modules. It allows arbitrary nesting of commands, automatic help page generation, and supports lazy loading of subcommands at runtime.
